# Sequence-Alignment (Optimal)
This program takes two string inputs and outputs the optimal alignment for the two strings.

Two things are taken into consideration: gaps and mismatches.
In the current verrsion of the program, "optimal" is defined as same letter > both vowel/consonant > gap > not both vowel/consonant.

### Usage
This program can be integrated into sentence spell checking or even DNA sequence checking. However, that requires small tweaks. Contact me for those tweaks!
